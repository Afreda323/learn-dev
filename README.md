# Getting Dev Job Ready in 2019

## What?

Below is a list of things you would typically need to know to get employed as a junior-mid level developer in 2019. I made this so that I can have a place to point people that have any questions for me about the steps they should take to try and break into the field.

If I have missed anything, or am lacking in the resources department, feel free to hit me with a PR and I'd be happy to add it to the list.

Also please note that some of the resources lifted are part of paid services.  I'm trying to keep this as low cost as possible, but I can't help that some of the best resources cost some money.

## Why?

While there are plenty of resources online for learning the tools of the trade, it can be a little hard for someone new to the game to find what they need, especially when most of the time they aren't sure exactly what "it" is.

It can also be a little difficult for beginners to find things that are up to date with this rapidly advancing field. So I am making it a priority to keep this list updated.

## Getting Started

Every section of this guide has a set of links to tutorials as well as a list of other resources that I find will help as a supplement to the guides.

Aside from links, this guide also has some projects for you to do.  You are not limited to these, so if you want to build your own stuff in the process, feel free.  The more you make the better you will get.

Once you make it through the javascript section, I recommend that you head to these links and do at least one challenge a day.  It will dramatically help with your critical thinking and interview skills.

## Front End

> Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to graphical interface for user to view and interact with data through digital interaction using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development)

Front end development has blown up into a very complex field in recent years.  What was once handled directly on the server has made it's way to the browser, whether that's caching data, handling interactions with external services, or a plethora of other things.  You now also have to accommodate for various different screen sizes, as well as take into account performance and accessibility.

While it is not necessary to know everything front end to get a job, there is certainly a lot you do have to know.  So below, I am going to do my best to point you in the best direction. So hopefully, if you stick with it, you'll have a pretty sweet resume and portfolio full of sweet skills and projects to show off to the world, and most likely get your foot in the door of what in my opinion is one the most fulfilling careers out there.


### Getting your feet wet

It's time to see if this is really something you want to do.

#### HTML & CSS Basics

HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the web.  HTML is how you define all of the text, images, links, etc on the page.  CSS is how you make it all look good and accessible to the user.

**Warning:** This may seem a little scary at first, but I promise that if you stick with it, it will be super rewarding.

#### First Project

It's time to put your new skills to the test, find one of your favorite websites on the internet, and do your best to clone it with HTML and CSS.  I would recommend starting with something simple like google.com, but if that's too easy, feel free to find something more comlex.

If you find yourself stuck, feel free to google how to do things, it's good to get into this habit as early on as possible.

##### Ideas

- https://google.com

### Still here?

Now that you have at least one custm built website under your belt, you can move onto the more exciting things, like learning your first CSS framework as well as how to lay out more advanced pages.  

It is also a good time to learn git so that you can push your code to the internet and share it with the world.

#### Intermediate HTML & CSS

Previously, you only scratched the surface when it comes to the languages of the web.  The below links will take your skills to the next level.

#### Bootstrap

When first released, bootstrap was one of the biggest things to hit the internet.  It streamlined a lot of tedious styling tasks, as well as made a bunch of sites on the internet look pretty damn good.  Some of these sites inlcude Lyft, TurboTax and Spotify.

#### Second Project

Feel like a pro yet? If so, it's time to build yourself a portfolio website.  When doing this, be sure to have at least the following pages:

- About (Talk about yourself)
- Work (Explain the projects you have previously done)
- Contact (Social links and how to get a hold of you)

#### Git

Git is an open source version control system that makes working with others a breeze, it is a foundational part of day to day development and is a must to know if you want to get into the field.  It is super fast and easy to use. 

GitHub is a place to host your code and share it with others.  As well as contribute to other people's code.

#### Deploying your sites

Having some HTML and CSS sitting on your computer/GitHub is cool and all, but it would be a lot better to actually have something live on the internet.  Below is several tutorials for the different flavors of pushing your sites to a live server or CDN.
