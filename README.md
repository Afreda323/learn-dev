# Getting Dev Job Ready in 2019

## What?

Below is a list of things you would typically need to know to get employed as a junior-mid level developer in 2019. I made this so that I can have a place to point people that have any questions for me about the steps they should take to try and break into the field.

If I have missed anything, or am lacking in the resources department, feel free to hit me with a PR and I'd be happy to add it to the list.

## Why?

While there are plenty of resources online for learning the tools of the trade, it can be a little hard for someone new to the game to find what they need, especially when most of the time they aren't sure exactly what "it" is.

It can also be a little difficult for beginners to find things that are up to date with this rapidly advancing field. So I am making it a priority to keep this list updated.

## Front End

> Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to graphical interface for user to view and interact with data through digital interaction using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development)

Front end development has blown up into a very complex field in recent years.  What was once handled directly on the server has made it's way to the browser, whether that's caching data, handling interactions with external services, or a plethora of other things.  You now also have to accommodate for various different screen sizes, as well as take into account performance and accessibility.

While it is not necessary to know everything front end to get a job, there is certainly a lot you do have to know.  So below, I am going to do my best to point you in the best direction. So hopefully, if you stick with it, you'll have a pretty sweet resume and portfolio full of sweet skills and projects to show off to the world, and most likely get your foot in the door of what in my opinion is one the most fulfilling careers out there.


### Getting your feet wet

It's time to see if this is really something you want to do.

#### HTML & CSS Basics

HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the web.  HTML is how you define all of the text, images, links, etc on the page.  CSS is how you make it all look good and accessible to the user.

#### First Project

### Still here?

Now that you have at least one custm built website under your belt, you can move onto the more exciting things, like learning your first CSS framework as well as how to lay out more advanced pages.  

It is also a good time to learn git so that you can push your code to the internet and share it with the world.
